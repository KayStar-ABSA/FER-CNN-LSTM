# 😎 MoodMe Emotion Detection App

Welcome to **MoodMe Emotion Detection App**! 🎉 This app is your pocket-sized emotion detector powered by the magic of machine learning and React Native! Get ready to see your emotions in action!

## 📸 Features

1. **Camera (Front and Back)** - Smile, you're on camera! Or don't... it's your choice! The app uses both front and back cameras to capture your beautiful (or brooding) face.
   
2. **Face Tracking** - Ever feel like you're being watched? Well, now you are! The app tracks your face in real-time to make sure it's only focusing on you... and not your cat.

3. **Emotion Detection** - Using an ONNX model, we dive deep into your soul (okay, just your face) to detect what you're really feeling. Are you Neutral, Surprised, or Sad? We'll find out! 😉

## 🎯 How It Works

- **Feature 1 (Camera)**: It all starts here! The camera captures your face, whether you're pouting or grinning ear to ear.

- **Feature 2 (Face Tracking)**: The face tracker zeroes in on your mug and extracts a 48x48 pixel region of your face, grayscale style! It's like a retro, pixelated version of you! 🕹️

- **Feature 3 (Emotion Detection)**: The ONNX model takes that 48x48 grayscale image and decides if you're feeling Neutral, Surprised, or Sad. Emotions, distilled down to their purest form.
